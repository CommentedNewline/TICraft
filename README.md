# Ti84CE-Blocks-3D
A(n attempt) to reimplement TheScienceElf's Minecraft Clone (Blocks) using perspective correct 3D rendering
Currently just a slow (but not _that_ slow all things considered) software 3D cube rendering engine
(Yes... it only renderes cubes, though it could probably be modified to support any shape made of quads if assembled correctly)

Build using the CEdev C/C++ toolchain
