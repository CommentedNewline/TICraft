Pamplemousse by MrFruitTree aims to simulate the look and feel of an HD texture pack, within a compact 16x16 package. It blends simplicity with complexity in order to create a smooth, clean, and dynamic gaming experience. 

The theme of Pamplemousse is based around modern design and architecture, yet it still retains a very traditional style. This allows for creating anything you would like without having to use multiple texture packs. 


All of the textures in this pack are property of their respective owners. This texture pack is for personal use only. You may not copy or distribute any of the textures in this pack without permission from the creator.
